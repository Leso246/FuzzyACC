# ðŸš— Design and Implementation of a Fuzzy Logic-Based Adaptive Cruise Control System

This project was carried out for the **Complex and Uncertain Systems** course,  
first year of the Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca  
(_UNIMIB@Disco_), September 2025 exam session.

> **Grade:** 30L/30

The research focuses on the design and simulation of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system that uses Fuzzy Logic to intelligently manage the safe distance from the preceding vehicle. The goal is to improve driving smoothness and safety under highway traffic conditions.
