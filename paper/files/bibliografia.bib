ABSTRACT = {Under the trend of vehicle intelligentization, many electrical control functions and control methods have been proposed to improve vehicle comfort and safety, among which the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is a typical example. However, the tracking performance, comfort and control robustness of the ACC system need more attention under uncertain environments and changing motion states. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical control strategy, including a dynamic normal wheel load observer, a Fuzzy Model Predictive Controller and an integral-separate PID executive layer controller. Firstly, a deep learning-based dynamic normal wheel load observer is added to the perception layer of the conventional ACC system and the observer output is used as a prerequisite for brake torque allocation. Secondly, a Fuzzy Model Predictive Control (fuzzy-MPC) method is adopted in the ACC system controller design, which establishes performance indicators, including tracking performance and comfort, as objective functions, dynamically adjusts their weights and determines constraint conditions based on safety indicators to adapt to continuously changing driving scenarios. Finally, the executive controller adopts the integral-separate PID method to follow the vehicle’s longitudinal motion commands, thus improving the system’s response speed and execution accuracy. A rule-based ABS control method was also developed to further improve the driving safety of vehicles under different road conditions. The proposed strategy has been simulated and validated in different typical driving scenarios and the results show that the proposed method provides better tracking accuracy and stability than traditional techniques.},
